# UserRecProfile Class

For now this will be just a class with one attribute. One day this might be much more elaborate.

It could also be a database table row, which records previous profiles generated from previous conversations.

## JSON Object Definition

For now, it may be simplest to define this "class" as just a JSON object, without class declaration.

`userRecProfile = {keyWordList: ['shoes', 'Nike', 'Phil', 'Knight']}`

## Attributes

keyWordList - an array of keywords to search in book database for recommendations. Array can be any length
